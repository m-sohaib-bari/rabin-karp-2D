Rabin-Karp 2D Pattern Matching in C++: Efficiently finds patterns within text matrices. Utilizes hashing for speedy substring comparison. Contributions welcome.

Rabin-Karp Algorithm for 2D Pattern Matching:
This repository contains a basic implementation of the Rabin-Karp algorithm for 2D pattern matching in C++.

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string searching algorithm that efficiently finds occurrences of a pattern within a text using hashing. This implementation extends the Rabin-Karp algorithm to work with 2D matrices, where it searches for a 2D pattern within a 2D text matrix.

Features:
Efficiently searches for a 2D pattern within a 2D text matrix.
Utilizes hashing for fast comparison of substrings.

Usage:
Simply compile and run the provided C++ code to perform 2D pattern matching using the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

Contributions:
Contributions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests.
